# Members Only Rails app:

Simon Tharby's solution to Project 2: Members Only!, Authentication section, Ruby on Rails unit, Odin Project.

Note: To log in to the live app, use;

`email: foo@bar.com`

`password: foobar`
## Assignment instructions:

"In this project, youâ€™ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it." ... + further explicit guidance.

In summary, the exercise requires the construction of a login page, an index of user posts where only logged-in users can see the name of the post authors, and the respective routes, models and controllers these require (including session cookies to 'remember' a logged-in user). The key concepts are the use of a secure password digest method, a browser cookie 'remember user login' method (with secure remember token digest), and limiting access to certain functions (esp: viewing post author names) to signed-in users only.

## My implementation:

As well as addressing the assignment requirements I also enforced SSL use on the Heroku server (for this app), implemented tests of all models and controllers, and added integration tests (including for attempted new post creation).

I added changes to the visibility of links in the header, dependent on login status. 'Publish' (links to posts/new) and 'Log out' are visible only when logged in, 'Log in' is visible only when logged out.

Root = posts_path.

Attempting to access posts/new when not logged in will redirect to the login_path.

Submitting invalid form data results in an appropriate error flash message (for both the login and new post forms) + details of the errors (new post forms).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
